                    I'm equally amazed and intimidated by them. The idea of getting a pretty good solution for a challenging problem so quickly feels very powerful. Basing algorithms on ideas taken from other fields of study is something that I really admire because it requires
                    a lot of creativity and the ability to see the big picture. It's also a fun puzzle to think of a proper data representation, tweak parameters and maintain the exploration vs. exploitation balance.

                <h2>Analytic Combinatorics</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    I feel like I've yet to grasp the most powerful tools the subject offers, but the basics were very promising nonetheless. Using the symbolic method was an interesting exercise that required a bit of creativity. I believe simplifying problems to simpler
                    models is a crucial skill in computer science – and analytic combinatorics can teach you just that. I also enjoy the applicability of it. The range of problems that may be solved using a small set of abstract operators made me appreciate
                    how much thought went into creating the subject.

                        I spend a lot of time taking care of my houseplants. Seeing them grow brings me a lot of joy. Having something to look after has helped me a lot during the pandemic. I'm also a serial propagator, which is why I ended up with eight Dracaenas in my bedroom.
                        They say you shouldn't pick between your children, but my peace lily is probably a favourite.

                        I've always liked baking because I enjoyed the eating part. That was until I've stumbled upon some YouTube videos with people explaining the science behind it. Now that I understand what I'm doing – at least a little bit – I find the process much more
                        exciting. I enjoy working with sourdough and yeast the most, and the magic of gluten development amazes me to this day.
